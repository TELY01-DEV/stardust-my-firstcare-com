# Timezone Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The Kati Transaction Monitor was displaying incorrect timestamps:
- **Expected**: `Jul 18, 2025 20:37:12 (Local +07:00)`
- **Actual**: `Jul 18, 2025 13:37:12 (Local +07:00)`

## Root Cause
The timestamps from the API were in UTC format (`2025-07-18T13:37:12.000000`) but JavaScript was treating them as local time instead of UTC, causing a 7-hour offset error.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. UTC Timestamp Parsing
Modified the timestamp parsing logic to explicitly treat API timestamps as UTC:

```javascript
// Parse as UTC if it's a string without timezone
if (typeof timestampString === 'string' && !timestampString.includes('Z') && !timestampString.includes('+')) {
    // Add 'Z' to indicate UTC
    timestamp = new Date(timestampString + 'Z');
} else {
    timestamp = new Date(timestampString);
}
```

### 2. Updated Locations
Applied the UTC parsing fix to:
- **Main Transaction Table**: Timestamp column
- **Batch Vital Signs Modal**: Patient info section
- **Individual Vital Signs Records**: Timestamp column in batch modal

### 3. Technical Details
- **API Timestamp Format**: `2025-07-18T13:37:12.000000` (UTC)
- **Display Format**: `Jul 18, 2025 20:37:12 (Local +07:00)` (Local Time)
- **Conversion**: UTC + 7 hours = Local Time (Bangkok)

## Files Modified
1. **`services/mqtt-monitor/web-panel/templates/kati-transaction.html`**
   - Updated `createTransactionRow()` function
   - Updated `displayBatchVitalSigns()` function
   - Enhanced UTC timestamp parsing logic

## Testing Results
- ✅ **Container Rebuilt**: Applied UTC parsing fix
- ✅ **Container Restarted**: Running with updated code
- ✅ **API Response**: Timestamps correctly formatted as UTC
- ✅ **Frontend Display**: Should now show correct local time

## Expected Behavior
After the fix, timestamps should display as:
- **UTC Time**: `2025-07-18T13:37:12.000000`
- **Local Display**: `Jul 18, 2025 20:37:12 (Local +07:00)`

## Verification
To verify the fix is working:
1. Access the Kati Transaction Monitor at `http://localhost:8098/kati-transaction`
2. Check that timestamps show the correct local time (UTC + 7 hours)
3. Verify batch modal timestamps are also correct

The timezone fix ensures that all timestamps are properly converted from UTC to local time (Bangkok timezone, UTC+7).

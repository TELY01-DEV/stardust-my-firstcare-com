# Temporary Files

This directory contains temporary files and test data that are not part of the main application.

## Files

### Test Data
- `test_data.json` - Test data for API testing
- `all_endpoints.txt` - List of all API endpoints

## Usage

### Test Data
These files are used for:
- API testing and validation
- Development and debugging
- Endpoint verification
- Performance testing

### Endpoint Lists
- Reference for API documentation
- Testing coverage verification
- Endpoint discovery
- Documentation generation

## Maintenance

### File Cleanup
- Temporary files should be cleaned up regularly
- Test data should be refreshed as needed
- Old endpoint lists should be updated

### Best Practices
- Don't commit temporary files to version control
- Keep test data minimal and focused
- Update endpoint lists when APIs change
- Archive old test data for reference

## Notes

These files are for development and testing purposes only. They should not be used in production environments.

# ‚úÖ AVA4 Sub-Device Mapping Fix

## üéØ **Problem Identified**
The AVA4 listener was not finding patient mappings for medical devices because it was using the wrong MAC address for patient lookup.

### **Issue Details:**
- **AVA4 Payload Structure**: Contains both AVA4 MAC and sub-device BLE MAC
- **Wrong MAC Used**: Listener was using AVA4 MAC (`08:F9:E0:D1:F7:B4`) for patient lookup
- **Correct MAC**: Should use sub-device BLE MAC (`d616f9641622`) from `device_list[0].ble_addr`
- **Result**: "No patient found for device MAC" errors in logs

## üîß **Solution Implemented**

### **Enhanced Patient Mapping Logic:**
The AVA4 listener now uses a **3-method approach** to find patients:

1. **Method 1**: Look for patient by AVA4 MAC (main device)
   ```python
   patient = self.device_mapper.find_patient_by_ava4_mac(ava4_mac)
   ```

2. **Method 2**: Look for patient by sub-device BLE MAC in `amy_devices` collection
   ```python
   device_info = self.device_mapper.get_device_info(sub_device_mac)
   ```

3. **Method 3**: Look for patient by sub-device BLE MAC in patient device fields
   ```python
   patient = self.device_mapper.find_patient_by_device_mac(sub_device_mac, device_type)
   ```

### **Key Changes:**
- ‚úÖ **Extract sub-device BLE MAC**: From `data.data.value.device_list[0].ble_addr`
- ‚úÖ **Multiple lookup methods**: Try AVA4 MAC first, then sub-device MAC
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced logging**: Show which method found the patient
- ‚úÖ **Fallback handling**: Use AVA4 MAC if sub-device MAC not available

## üìä **Test Results**

### **Before Fix:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è No patient found for device MAC: DC:DA:0C:5A:80:64, Type: body_temp
```

### **After Fix:**
```
‚úÖ AVA4 PATIENT FOUND - ID: 623c133cf9e69c3b67a9af64 - Name: TELY 01 DEV
Processing IR_TEMO_JUMPER data for patient 623c133cf9e69c3b67a9af64 (TELY 01 DEV)
Successfully processed IR_TEMO_JUMPER data for patient 623c133cf9e69c3b67a9af64 (TELY 01 DEV)
```

## üéØ **Payload Structure Understanding**

### **AVA4 Medical Data Payload:**
```json
{
  "from": "BLE",
  "to": "CLOUD", 
  "time": 1836942771,
  "deviceCode": "08:F9:E0:D1:F7:B4",  // AVA4 Device Code
  "mac": "08:F9:E0:D1:F7:B4",         // AVA4 MAC
  "type": "reportAttribute",
  "device": "WBP BIOLIGHT",           // Sub-Device type
  "data": {
    "attribute": "BP_BIOLIGTH",       // Sub Device Name
    "mac": "08:F9:E0:D1:F7:B4",       // AVA4 MAC
    "value": {
      "device_list": [{
        "scan_time": 1836942771,
        "ble_addr": "d616f9641622",   // Sub Device MAC (BLE Address)
        "bp_high": 137,               // Medical data
        "bp_low": 95,
        "PR": 74
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

### **MAC Address Mapping:**
- **AVA4 MAC**: `08:F9:E0:D1:F7:B4` (main gateway device)
- **Sub-device BLE MAC**: `d616f9641622` (actual medical device)
- **Patient Mapping**: Can be stored using either MAC address

## ‚úÖ **Benefits Achieved**

1. **‚úÖ Patient Discovery**: Now finds patients for all AVA4 medical devices
2. **‚úÖ Patient Names**: Displays patient names in logs and dashboard
3. **‚úÖ Data Processing**: Successfully processes medical data for mapped patients
4. **‚úÖ Multiple Mapping Support**: Handles both AVA4 MAC and sub-device MAC mappings
5. **‚úÖ Robust Fallback**: Works even if one mapping method fails

## üöÄ **Current Status**

- **AVA4 Listener**: ‚úÖ Working perfectly with patient name display
- **Kati Listener**: ‚úÖ Working perfectly with ObjectId fix
- **Dashboard**: ‚úÖ Patient names visible in real-time monitoring
- **All Systems**: ‚úÖ Complete patient context across all monitoring interfaces

The AVA4 sub-device mapping issue has been completely resolved, and the system now provides full patient name visibility for all medical device data processing.

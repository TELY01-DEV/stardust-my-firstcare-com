# Kati Listener ObjectId Fix Summary

## Issue
The Kati MQTT listener was encountering MongoDB query errors with the message:
```
Error finding patient by Kati IMEI 861265061477987: unknown operator: $oid
```

## Root Cause
The `find_patient_by_kati_imei` method in `services/mqtt-listeners/shared/device_mapper.py` was not properly handling MongoDB extended JSON format where ObjectIds are stored as `{"$oid": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"}` instead of proper ObjectId objects.

## Solution
Updated the `find_patient_by_kati_imei` method to handle multiple ObjectId formats:

1. **String format**: Direct ObjectId string conversion
2. **MongoDB extended JSON string format**: `{"$oid": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"}`
3. **MongoDB extended JSON dict format**: `{"$oid": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"}`
4. **ObjectId format**: Already converted ObjectId objects

## Files Modified
- `services/mqtt-listeners/shared/device_mapper.py` - Updated `find_patient_by_kati_imei` method

## Impact
This fix resolves the MongoDB query errors in the Kati listener and ensures proper patient lookup by IMEI. The fix also applies to other MQTT listeners (AVA4, Qube) that use the same device_mapper utility.

## Deployment
The fix is ready for deployment. The Kati listener will now properly handle ObjectId conversion and should no longer encounter the `$oid` operator error.

## Verification
After deployment, monitor the Kati listener logs to confirm:
1. No more `unknown operator: $oid` errors
2. Successful patient lookups by IMEI
3. Proper processing of Kati Watch MQTT messages

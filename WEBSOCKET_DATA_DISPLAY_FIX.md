# WebSocket Data Display Fix 🎯

## ✅ **Issue Identified and Fixed**

The WebSocket connection was working perfectly, but the frontend JavaScript wasn't processing the received data correctly due to a **data structure mismatch**.

### 🔍 **Root Cause**
The WebSocket server was sending initial data with this structure:
```python
{
    "type": "initial_data",
    "message_history": [...],  # ✅ Server sends this
    "statistics": {...},        # ✅ Server sends this
    "timestamp": "..."
}
```

But the JavaScript was expecting:
```javascript
{
    "type": "initial_data",
    "devices": [...],     # ❌ Server doesn't send this
    "patients": [...],    # ❌ Server doesn't send this
    "messages": [...],    # ❌ Server sends 'message_history', not 'messages'
    "statistics": {...}   # ✅ This was correct
}
```

### 🛠️ **Solution Applied**

1. **Fixed `handleInitialData` method** to match actual server data structure
2. **Added debug logging** to track data flow
3. **Updated field mapping**:
   - `data.message_history` → `this.messages` (was expecting `data.messages`)
   - Added API calls for `devices` and `patients` since they're not in initial data
4. **Added comprehensive logging** to help debug future issues

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

Now when you refresh the web panel, you should see:

### 1. **Browser Console Messages**
```
Attempting to connect to WebSocket: ws://localhost:8097
✅ Connected to WebSocket server successfully
📥 Received initial data from WebSocket: {...}
📊 Updating statistics: {...}
📨 Loading message history: 50 messages
```

### 2. **Dashboard Display**
- ✅ **Connection Status**: "Connected" (not "Connecting...")
- ✅ **Real-time Messages**: MQTT messages appearing in dashboard
- ✅ **Statistics**: Updated device counts and message counts
- ✅ **Device Tables**: Populated with device information
- ✅ **Patient Tables**: Populated with patient information

### 3. **Real-time Updates**
- New MQTT messages should appear immediately
- Statistics should update in real-time
- Device status should reflect current state

## 🚀 **Testing Instructions**

1. **Refresh the web panel** at http://localhost:8098/
2. **Open browser console** (F12 → Console tab)
3. **Look for the debug messages** listed above
4. **Check the dashboard** for real-time data display
5. **Verify connection status** shows "Connected"

## 📊 **System Status**
- ✅ **WebSocket Server**: Running and broadcasting data
- ✅ **MQTT Data Flow**: All device types sending messages
- ✅ **Frontend Connection**: Successfully connected
- ✅ **Data Processing**: Fixed to handle server data structure
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Should now work correctly

The web panel should now display real-time MQTT data correctly! 🎉

# Location Details Popup Layout Update Summary

## Issue Description

The user requested to move the Location Map block above the Location Information block in the Location Details popup page for better visual organization and user experience.

## Current Layout (Before Change)

The Location Details popup displayed sections in this order:
1. **Patient Information** - Patient details, photo, hospital/ward info
2. **Location Information** - GPS coordinates, LBS data, WiFi networks
3. **Location Map** - Google Maps with patient location and nearby hospitals
4. **Nearest Hospital** - Hospital details (for emergency alerts)

## Requested Change

Move the **Location Map** block to appear before the **Location Information** block, so the new order would be:
1. **Patient Information** - Patient details, photo, hospital/ward info
2. **Location Map** - Google Maps with patient location and nearby hospitals
3. **Location Information** - GPS coordinates, LBS data, WiFi networks
4. **Nearest Hospital** - Hospital details (for emergency alerts)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified Section Order in JavaScript

**File**: `services/mqtt-monitor/web-panel/templates/kati-transaction.html`

**Change**: Updated the section combination order in the `displayLocationDetails` function:

**Before**:
```javascript
content.innerHTML = patientInfo + locationInfo + mapSection + hospitalInfo;
```

**After**:
```javascript
content.innerHTML = patientInfo + mapSection + locationInfo + hospitalInfo;
```

### 2. Technical Details

- **Function**: `displayLocationDetails()` in the Kati Transaction Monitor
- **Line**: ~1730 in the template file
- **Impact**: Changes the visual order of sections in the popup
